<h2>About This Domain</h2>

<p>
  This domain is managed by an individual. Although the RFC defines <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved">example.*</a> domains for such purposes, I think <span class="domain">yourcompany.dev</span> is much cooler than <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved">example.*</a> domains. :)
